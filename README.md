## 🔒 Privacy Features

### How Zero-Knowledge Voting Works

1. **Voter Registration**: Eligible voters are added to a Merkle tree registry
2. **Vote Casting**: Users generate ZK proofs proving:
   - They are registered voters (Merkle tree membership)
   - They haven't voted before (unique nullifier)
   - Their vote is valid (yes/no choice)
3. **Privacy Preservation**: The proof reveals no information about:
   - Voter identity
   - Vote choice
   - Any linking between voters and votes
4. **Result Aggregation**: Votes are tallied using cryptographic aggregation

### Double Vote Prevention

The system uses **cryptographic nullifiers** to prevent double voting:

```
nullifier = hash(voterSecret + proposalId + salt)
```

**How it works:**
- Each voter's secret + proposal ID generates a unique nullifier
- Same voter voting twice = same nullifier = rejected
- Different voters = different nullifiers = allowed
- Cross-proposal voting = different nullifiers = allowed

**Security Properties:**
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same nullifier
- **Unlinkable**: Cannot trace nullifier back to voter identity
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can verify no nullifier appears twice
- **Efficient**: O(1) lookup to check for duplicates

### Security Guarantees

- **Anonymity**: Impossible to link votes to voters
- **Integrity**: All votes are cryptographically verified
- **No Double Voting**: Nullifier system prevents repeat voting
- **Verifiability**: Anyone can verify the election results
- **Sybil Resistance**: Only pre-registered voters can participate

## 🧪 Technical Implementation

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation

The system generates proofs for:
- Voter eligibility (Merkle tree membership)
- Vote validity (binary choice: 0 or 1)
- Non-reusability (unique nullifier per vote)

```typescript
const proof = await generateVoteProof({
  proposalId: "proposal_1",
  choice: 1, // 0 for No, 1 for Yes
  voterSecret: "user_secret_key",
  nullifier: "unique_nullifier"
});
```

### Privacy-Preserving Vote Aggregation

Votes are aggregated without revealing individual choices:
1. Each vote generates a commitment
2. Commitments are collected on-chain
3. Final tallies are computed using ZK aggregation
4. Results published without compromising privacy
